# Rice-Leaf-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to classify rice leaf diseasesâ€”Leaf Smut, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight. It includes data preprocessing, model comparison, and data augmentation to enhance accuracy and robustness, aiding early detection through image-based analysis of 120 labeled leaf images.
