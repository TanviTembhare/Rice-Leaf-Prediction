# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** capable of detecting and classifying rice leaf diseases from images.  
The model identifies three major diseases that commonly affect rice plants — **Leaf Smut**, **Brown Spot**, and **Bacterial Leaf Blight** — helping in early detection and prevention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data analysis** and preprocessing on the rice leaf dataset.
- Build and evaluate **multiple classification models** to identify the best performer.
- Apply **data augmentation** techniques to enhance dataset diversity and improve model performance.
- Generate detailed **performance comparison reports** and highlight key findings.

## 🧠 Dataset
The dataset consists of **120 images** of rice leaves categorized into three classes:
- 🌿 Leaf Smut  
- 🍂 Brown Spot  
- 🌾 Bacterial Leaf Blight  

Each class contains **40 images**.
